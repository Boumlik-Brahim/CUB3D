# CUB3D

The Cub3d project is a simple 3D game that uses the Raycasting technique to render a 3D view of a map. In this project, you will create a game that allows the player to navigate a maze-like environment and interact with objects in the game world.

# Installation:

To use this program in your projects, you must first compile it by running the following command:

`make`

This will compile the program into an executable file called cub3D. You can then run the program by entering the following command:

`./cub3D <path_to_map_file>`

# Usage:

The cub3D program reads a map file and renders a 3D view of the game world based on the information in the map file. The player can navigate the game world using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and can interact with objects in the game world by moving into them.

To play the game, simply run the cub3D executable with the path to the map file as the argument:

`./cub3D maps/map1.cub`

This will launch the game and display the 3D view of the game world on the screen.

# Functionality:

The cub3D program supports many of the basic functionalities of a 3D game engine, including:

- Rendering a 3D view of the game world using the Raycasting technique
- Navigating the game world using arrow keys on the keyboard
- Collision detection to prevent the player from moving through walls and objects in the game world
- Textures and colors for different objects in the game world
- A mini-map to show the player's position in the game world
- The program also includes error handling for invalid map files and other potential errors that may occur during gameplay.

# Conclusion:

The Cub3d project is a fun and engaging project that will help you to gain a better understanding of 3D game engines and the Raycasting technique. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to create a simple game from scratch, and how to use basic game functionalities to create more complex games.
